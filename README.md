# image-playground

Playing around with the image.rs crate to do some image manipulation.
Losely based on the youtube series of lectures found
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSphLtKQ0o&list=PLplnkTzzqsZTfYh4UbhLGpI5kGd5oW_Hh).

The code in main.rs is my attempt at first project assignment from
[here](https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs4600/fall2021/?prj=1).
The actual assignment was to be implemented in js. I am using Rust instead.
